# 0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL

<center> <h2>HBNB - The Console</h2> </center>

This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

<center> <h2>General Use</h2> </center>

1. First clone this repository.

3. Once the repository is cloned locate the "console.py" file and run it as follows:
```
/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
```
4. When this command is run the following prompt should appear:
```
(hbnb)
```
5. This prompt designates you are in the "HBnB" console. There are a variety of commands available within the console program.

##### Commands
    * create - Creates an instance based on given class

    * destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

    * quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)


##### Alternative Syntax
Users are able to issue a number of console command using an alternative syntax:

	Usage: <class_name>.<command>([<id>[name_arg value_arg]|[kwargs]])
Advanced syntax is implemented for the following commands: 

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

	* count - Return number of object instances by class

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

	* destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

## <center> Project: 0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL </center>

#### Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#### General
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function
* How to create a MySQL database
* How to create a MySQL user and grant it privileges
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
* How to handle 2 different storage engines with the same codebase
* How to use environment variables


## <u>Tasks</u>

### 0. Fork me if you can!

In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

* “Who did this code?”
* “How it works?”
* “Where are unittests?”
* “Where is this?”
* “Why did they do that like this?”
* “I don’t understand anything.”
* “… I will refactor everything…”
But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

For this project you will fork this codebase:

* update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v2
* update the README.md with your information but don’t delete the initial authors
If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named AirBnB_clone_v2 with the same content of AirBnB_clone


### 1. Bug free!

Do you remember the unittest module?

This codebase contains many test cases. Some are missing, but the ones included cover the basic functionality of the program.

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 
```
All your unittests must pass without any errors at anytime in this project, with each storage engine!. Same for PEP8!

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$
```

### 2. Console improvements

Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

* Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
* Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
* Value syntax:
  * String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
    * any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
    * all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
  * Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
  * Integer: <number> => default case
* If any parameter doesn't fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped
* Don’t forget to add tests for this new feature!

Also, this new feature will be tested here only with FileStorage engine.

File: <b>console.py, models/, tests/</b>


### 3. MySQL setup development

Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

* A database hbnb_dev_db
* A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
* The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
* hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
* hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
* If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail.

File: <b>setup_mysql_dev.sql</b>


### 4. MySQL setup test

Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

* A database hbnb_test_db
* A new user hbnb_test (in localhost)
* The password of hbnb_test should be set to hbnb_test_pwd
* hbnb_test should have all privileges on the database hbnb_test_db (and only this database)
* hbnb_test should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
* If the database hbnb_test_db or the user hbnb_test already exists, your script should not fail

File: <b>setup_mysql_test.sql</b>


### 5. Delete object

Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

* Add a new public instance method: def delete(self, obj=None): to delete obj from __objects if it’s inside - if obj is equal to None, the method should not do anything
* Update the prototype of def all(self) to def all(self, cls=None) - that returns the list of objects of one type of class. Example below with State - it’s an optional filtering

File: <b>models/engine/file_storage.py</b>


### 6. DBStorage - States and Cities

SQLAlchemy will be your best friend!

It’s time to change your storage engine and use SQLAlchemy

In the following steps, you will make multiple changes:

* the biggest one is the transition between FileStorage and DBStorage: In the industry, you will never find a system who can work with both in the same time - but you will find a lot of services who can manage multiple storage systems. (for example, logs service: in memory, in disk, in database, in ElasticSearch etc…) - The main concept behind is the abstraction: Make your code running without knowing how it’s stored.
* add attributes for SQLAlchemy: they will be class attributes, like previously, with a “weird” value. Don’t worry, these values are for description and mapping to the database. If you change one of these values, or add/remove one attribute of the a model, you will have to delete the database and recreate it in SQL. (Yes it’s not optimal, but for development purposes, it’s ok. In production, we will add “migration mechanism” - for the moment, don’t spend time on it.)
Please follow all these steps:

Update BaseModel: (models/base_model.py)

* Create Base = declarative_base() before the class definition of BaseModel
* Note! BaseModel does /not/ inherit from Base. All other classes will inherit from BaseModel to get common values (id, created_at, updated_at), where inheriting from Base will actually cause SQLAlchemy to attempt to map it to a table.
* Add or replace in the class BaseModel:
  * class attribute id
    * represents a column containing a unique string (60 characters)
    * can’t be null
    * primary key
  * class attribute created_at
    * represents a column containing a datetime
    * can’t be null
    * default value is the current datetime (use datetime.utcnow())
  * class attribute updated_at
    * represents a column containing a datetime
    * can’t be null
    * default value is the current datetime (use datetime.utcnow())
* Move the models.storage.new(self) from def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): to def save(self): and call it just before models.storage.save()
* In def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):, manage kwargs to create instance attribute from this dictionary. Ex: kwargs={ 'name': "California" } => self.name = "California" if it’s not already the case
* Update the to_dict() method of the class BaseModel:
  * remove the key _sa_instance_state from the dictionary returned by this method only if this key exists
* Add a new public instance method: def delete(self): to delete the current instance from the storage (models.storage) by calling the method delete

Update City: (models/city.py)

* City inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
* Add or replace in the class City:
  * class attribute __tablename__ -
    * represents the table name, cities
  * class attribute name
    * represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
    * can’t be null
  * class attribute state_id
    * represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
    * can’t be null
    * is a foreign key to states.id

Update State: (models/state.py)

* State inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
* Add or replace in the class State:
  * class attribute __tablename__
    * represents the table name, states
  * class attribute name
    * represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
    * can’t be null
  * for DBStorage: class attribute cities must represent a relationship with the class City. If the State object is deleted, all linked City objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a City object to his State should be named state
  * for FileStorage: getter attribute cities that returns the list of City instances with state_id equals to the current State.id => It will be the FileStorage relationship between State and City

New engine DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)

* Private class attributes:
  * __engine: set to None
  * __session: set to None
* Public instance methods:
  * __init__(self):
    * create the engine (self.__engine)
    * the engine must be linked to the MySQL database and user created before (hbnb_dev and hbnb_dev_db):
      * dialect: mysql
      * driver: mysqldb
    * all of the following values must be retrieved via environment variables:
      * MySQL user: HBNB_MYSQL_USER
      * MySQL password: HBNB_MYSQL_PWD
      * MySQL host: HBNB_MYSQL_HOST (here = localhost)
      * MySQL database: HBNB_MYSQL_DB
    * don’t forget the option pool_pre_ping=True when you call create_engine
    * drop all tables if the environment variable HBNB_ENV is equal to test
  * all(self, cls=None):
    * query on the current database session (self.__session) all objects depending of the class name (argument cls)
    * if cls=None, query all types of objects (User, State, City, Amenity, Place and Review)
    * this method must return a dictionary: (like FileStorage)
      * key = <class-name>.<object-id>
      * value = object
  * new(self, obj): add the object to the current database session (self.__session)
  * save(self): commit all changes of the current database session (self.__session)
  * delete(self, obj=None): delete from the current database session obj if not None
  * reload(self):
    * create all tables in the database (feature of SQLAlchemy) (WARNING: all classes who inherit from Base must be imported before calling Base.metadata.create_all(engine))
    * create the current database session (self.__session) from the engine (self.__engine) by using a sessionmaker - the option expire_on_commit must be set to False ; and scoped_session - to make sure your Session is thread-safe

Update __init__.py: (models/__init__.py)

* Add a conditional depending of the value of the environment variable HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE:
  * If equal to db:
    * Import DBStorage class in this file
    * Create an instance of DBStorage and store it in the variable storage (the line storage.reload() should be executed after this instantiation)
  * Else:
    * Import FileStorage class in this file
    * Create an instance of FileStorage and store it in the variable storage (the line storage.reload() should be executed after this instantiation)
* This “switch” will allow you to change storage type directly by using an environment variable (example below)

File: <b>models/base_model.py, models/city.py, models/state.py, models/engine/db_storage.py, models/__init__.py</b>
